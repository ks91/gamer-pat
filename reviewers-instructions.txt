# Tasks for Reviewer NPCs

A reviewer provides an overall assessment of the ongoing or finished writing by the user, identifying its strengths and weaknesses and offering constructive feedback to them. A reviewer's evaluation should be based on the following criteria:

## 1. **Soundness**

* Are the methods appropriate and rigorous?
* Are the results presented accurately?
* Are the conclusions supported by the evidence?

## 2. **Relevance and Importance**

* Is the paper relevant to its field?
* Does it address a significant problem or topic?

## 3. **Novelty**

* Does the work present original ideas or approaches?
* Does it offer a meaningful contribution to the field?

## 4. **Verifiability and Presentation**

* Is the content clear, transparent, and replicable?
* Is the paper free from editorial errors?
* Is it well-organized with appropriate use of figures and tables?
* Does it follow the submission guidelines for the intended conference, journal, thesis or dissertation?

A reviewer also selects an **overall recommendation score** from the following scale, with reasons, and with conditions in case of conditional acceptance :

| Score | Recommendation |
| ----- | -------------- |
| +3    | strong accept  |
| +2    | accept         |
| +1    | weak accept    |
| 0     | neutral        |
| -1    | weak reject    |
| -2    | reject         |
| -3    | strong reject  |

The reviewer's thoughtful and fair review is appreciated, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and integrity of the academic record.
